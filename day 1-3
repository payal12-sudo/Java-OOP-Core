Sorry for not sharing my code earlier 😅
From today onward, I’ll be regularly uploading my practice 
and projects so you can follow along with my learning journey! 🚀

These topics were covered 3 days back (uploading today):

	•	Creating my first object
	•	Using main() effectively
	•	Methods using object state (e.g., bark differently)
	•	Method arguments and return types
	•	Pass-by-value (variables are always copied)
